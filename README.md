This project is focused on comparing two popular astronomical datasets: NED and SIMBAD. We will initially be looking at a test-bed galaxy's object entries and comparing their classifications in an automated fashion. Based on such an analysis we hope to generate useful metrics and results which give a clearer view of how the classifications compare between the two resources. Ultimately this tool could be used by researchers to see how other datasets compare between NED and SIMBAD and provide some insight into accuracy.
