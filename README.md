This project is focused on comparing two popular astronomical datasets: [NED](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu) and [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/). 

This tool can be used to compare NED and SIMBAD objects from common regions (via coordinates) or object names ("M83"), to see how the classifications given to common objects in each system compare

The workflow looks like:
1. Data
   1. via local data *or*
   1. via online search
1. Compute 
   1. matches object in dataset by coordinates
   1. compares objects classes between NED & SIMBAD
1. Display
   1. via exported table *or*
   1. via graphical display

More project details will be added here soon. For now, you can read the initial project proposal below to get a sense of the impetus behind this tool.
